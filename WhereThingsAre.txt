We are using Bash for Windows and building and running from:

cd /mnt/e/development/positivecoin

Since we are building and running in Bash for Windows, the file system used at runtime is hidden away here:

C:\Users\cjvilla\AppData\Local\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc\LocalState\rootfs

Now, a handy command to find wtf files are stored, use this bash command:

find / -name wallet.dat -print 2>/dev/null

(which we found at https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Data_directory)

Et voila, it shows us:

/home/cj/.positive/wallets/wallet.dat

And this is where positive.conf needs to be at runtime for the Wallet to connect to us and not to Litecoin.
